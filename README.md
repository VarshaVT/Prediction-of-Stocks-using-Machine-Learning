It's a machine learning challenge given by Correlation One Company

Given the stocks dataset that consists of the (simulated) daily open-toclose changes of 
a set of 10  stocks: S1, S2, …, S10. 
Stock S1 trades in the U.S. as part of the S&P 500 Index, while stocks S2, S3, …,  S10 trade in Japan, 
as part of the Nikkei Index.   

The task is to build a model to forecast S1, as a function of S1, S2, …, S10 .  
You should build your model using the first 50 rows of the dataset.  
The remaining 50 rows of the dataset have values for S1  missing: 
you will use your model to fill these in.
